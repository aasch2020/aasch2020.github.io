### Coursework Highlights and Skills
#### **CUDA Matrix Multiplication Optimization**

- Implemented high-performance GPU matrix multiplication with tiling, shared memory, coalesced accesses, and ILP.
- Achieved up to 3.27 TFLOPS, 25x speedup over naive implementation, and competitive performance with cuBLAS.
- Performed roofline analysis and tuned for edge cases (non-multiples of tile/warp sizes).

#### **2D Wave Simulation using MPI**

- Parallelized a 2D wave equation solver using MPI with a 5-point stencil.
- Implemented ghost-cell communication for arbitrary 1D and 2D processor geometries.
- Optimized memory layout for distributed grids to enable scaling across up to 384 cores.
- Conducted performance and scaling experiments on SDSC Expanse, achieving near-linear speedup.
- Validated correctness against serial implementation and measured MPI communication overhead.

### Coursework Highlights and Skills
#### **Operating System Kernel Project (PintOS)**

- Implemented kernel subsystems including process management, system calls, and synchronization primitives in C.
- Built virtual memory system with lazy loading, swap management, and clock page replacement.
- Designed and implemented a file system with indexed inodes and fine-grained locking.
- Developed user–kernel memory safety checks and page fault handling.


#### **Distributed Key-Value Store with Causal Consistency (Python)**

- Designed and implemented a replicated key-value store with causal consistency using vector clocks.

- Implemented replication and broadcast mechanisms using multithreaded worker queues.

- Built failure detection and view management through HTTP-based replica health monitoring.
