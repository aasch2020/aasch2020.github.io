### Coursework Highlights and Skills
#### Operating System Kernel Project (PintOS)

- Implemented kernel subsystems including process management, system calls, and synchronization primitives in C.

- Built virtual memory system with lazy loading, swap management, and clock page replacement.

- Designed and implemented a file system with indexed inodes and fine-grained locking.

- Developed user–kernel memory safety checks and page fault handling.


#### Distributed Key-Value Store with Causal Consistency (Python)

- Designed and implemented a replicated key-value store with causal consistency using vector clocks.

- Implemented replication and broadcast mechanisms using multithreaded worker queues.

- Built failure detection and view management through HTTP-based replica health monitoring.

- Implemented causal dependency tracking with vector clocks and deferred request processing.

- Developed concurrent request handling using Python threading and worker pools.

- Containerized distributed system using Docker.
