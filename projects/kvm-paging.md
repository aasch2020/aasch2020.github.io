# Enhancing KVM Page Eviction: From FIFO to Approximate LRU

**June 2025** | University of California San Diego

## Overview

Worked on shadow page table implementation to optimize paging policy; evaluated with stress-ng and redis-benchmark.

## Technologies

- KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)
- Page eviction policies
- Linux kernel development
- Benchmarking tools (stress-ng, redis-benchmark)

## Key Accomplishments

- Implemented approximate LRU paging policy to replace FIFO
- Optimized shadow page table handling in KVM
- Conducted comprehensive performance evaluation with industry-standard benchmarks
